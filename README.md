This is an implementation of the [Lolcode][] joke-turned-esoteric programming language using Ruby. Currently the parser is written using [Treetop][], but I'd like to rewrite it with a manual recursive descent parser for better error handling.

Back in university I wrote a Lolcode interpreter in Scheme (a modification of one of our projects). This year (2012) I got the itch to do it again, but this time more concretely and completely. And Ruby is very fun to program in: it's a sort of programmer's playground when it comes to computer science ideas. (Everything is an object, higher-order procedures are not just the norm but have nice syntactic support, and you don't have to worry about garbage collection.)

This is a spare-time, for-fun project, but if you're reading this, maybe you can have fun with it as well.
